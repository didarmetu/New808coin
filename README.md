### What is New808coin(N808)?

New808coin (N808) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that was designed with a primary focus on energy efficiency and music. The New808coin network utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which is based on a combination of masternodes and staking. This approach ensures that the New808coin blockchain has a low environmental impact and can easily scale to accommodate future growth.

One of the unique features of New808coin is its use of masternodes. These are specialized nodes on the network that perform advanced functions such as instant transactions, anonymous transactions, and decentralized governance. Masternodes are an integral part of the New808coin ecosystem, providing a higher level of security and reliability compared to other cryptocurrencies that rely solely on staking.

In terms of mining, New808coin only supports PoS mining. This means that users can earn rewards by simply holding N808 in their wallets, instead of having to use expensive mining hardware. This approach promotes a more eco-friendly and cost-effective mining process, making it easier for users to participate in the network.

At the launch of the New808coin network, there were premined coins and coins allocated for a user coin swap. The swap was designed for holders of the old PoW/PoS 808coin. Additionally, the Masternode Collateral changed until Phase 6 then its stable to 25,000 N808, and the minimum stake age has been set to 80.8 hours.

Overall, New808coin is a promising cryptocurrency with a unique focus on energy efficiency and music. Its use of masternodes and PoS mining make it a more secure and reliable cryptocurrency, while also promoting a more eco-friendly and cost-effective mining process.
